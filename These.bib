###### HOW-TO ######

To add a new entry in your bibliography chose the proper template below, copy-
paste it in the end of this file, replace the "_" by an "at-symbol" (this
symbol cannot be typed here otherwise the bibliography processing program
would think there's an entry inside this how-to), and fill its fields. Check
an proper entry example in the end of this file.

You can use the month macros (jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep,
oct, nov, dec) WITHOUT QUOTES to let the bib-style handle the language of the
month (French or English), like in the example in the end of the file.

Optional fields in the templates are commented out with a '%'. Note that not
all external programs that process bibliography information in .bib files
support comments inside the reference entry (notably bibtex doesn't), so you
may need to remove the fields you don't want/need in your entry instead of
leaving it commented out. Moreover, anything not starting with a "at-symbol"
is normally not processed by the bibliography processing program (like it was
just comments).

In the last years humanârobot interaction has become an important research field that spans all of the robot capabilities including perception, reasoning, learning, manipulation and navigation. For navigation, the presence of humans requires novel approaches that take into account the constraints of human comfort as well as social rules. Besides these constraints, putting robots among humans opens new interaction possibilities for robots, also for navigation tasks, such as robot guides. This paper provides a survey of existing approaches to human-aware navigation and offers a general classification scheme for the presented methods.},

The present work is based on the rules from proxemics which are used to design a passing strategy. In narrow corridors the lateral distance of passage is a key parameter to consider. An implemented system has been used in a small study to verify the basic parametric design for such a system. In total 10 subjects evaluated variations in proxemics for encounters with a robot in a corridor setting. The user feedback indicates that entering the intimate sphere of people is less comfortable, however a too significant avoidance is also considered unnecessary. Adequate signaling of avoidance is a behaviour that must be carefully tuned},

A collaborative robot's motion must be legible, or intent-expressive. Legibility is often described in the literature as and effect of predictable, unsurprising, or expected motion. Our central insight is that predictability and legibility are fundamentally different and often contradictory properties of motion. We develop a formalism to mathematically define and distinguish predictability and legibility of motion. We formalize the two based on inferences between trajectories and goals in opposing directions, drawing the analogy to action interpretation in psychology. We then propose mathematical models for these inferences based on optimizing cost, drawing the analogy to the principle of rational action. Our experiments validate our formalism's prediction that predictability and legibility can contradict, and provide support for our models. Our findings indicate that for robots to seamlessly collaborate with humans, they must change the way they plan their motion.},

	abstract = {Engaging storytelling is a necessary skill for humanoid robots if they are to be used in education and entertainment applications. Storytelling requires that the humanoid robot be aware of its audience and able to direct its gaze in a natural way. In this paper, we explore how human gaze can be modeled and implemented on a humanoid robot to create a natural, human-like behavior for storytelling. Our gaze model integrates data collected from a human storyteller and a discourse structure model developed by Cassell and her colleagues for human-like conversational agents (1994). We used this model to direct the gaze of a humanoid robot, Honda's ASIMO, as he recited a Japanese fairy tale using a pre-recorded human voice. We assessed the efficacy of this gaze algorithm by manipulating the frequency of ASIMO's gaze between two participants and used pre and post questionnaires to assess whether participants evaluated the robot more positively and did better on a recall task when ASIMO looked at them more. We found that participants performed significantly better in recalling ASIMO's story when the robot looked at them more. Our results also showed significant differences in how men and women evaluated ASIMO based on the frequency of gaze they received from the robot. Our study adds to the growing evidence that there are many commonalities between human-human communication and human-robot communication},

The system enables the robot to direct its gaze at multiple humans who are interacting with each other and with the robot. The attention mechanism of the gaze-control system is based on features that have been proven to guide human attention: nonverbal and verbal cues, proxemics, the visual field of view, and the habituation effect. Our gaze-control system uses Kinect skeleton tracking together with speech recognition and SHORE-based facial expression recognition to implement the same features. As part of a pilot evaluation, we collected the gaze behavior of 11 participants in an eye-tracking study. We showed participants videos of two-person interactions and tracked their gaze behavior. A comparison of the human gaze behavior with the behavior of our gaze-control system running on the same videos shows that it replicated human gaze behavior 89\% of the time.},

	doi = {10.1109/ECMR.2015.7324049},
	abstract = {When humans and mobile robots share the same space, one of their challenges is to navigate around each other and manage their mutual navigational intents. While humans have developed excellent skills in inferring their counterpart's intentions via a number of implicit and non-verbal cues, making navigation also in crowds an ease, this kind of effective and efficient communication often falls short in human-robot encounters. In this paper, two alternative approaches to convey navigational intent of a mobile robot to humans in a shared environment are proposed and analysed. The first is utilising anthropomorphic features of the mobile robot to realise an implicit joint attention using gaze to represent the direction of navigational intent. In the second approach, a more technical design adopting the semantics of car's turn indicators, has been implemented. The paper compares both approaches with each other and against a control behaviour without any communication of intent. Both approaches show statistically significant differences in comparison to the control behaviour. However, the second approach using indicators has shown as being more effective in conveying the intent and also has a higher positive impact on the comfort of the humans encountering the robot.},

The objectives considered in the trajectory optimization include but are not limited to the overall path length, trajectory execution time, separation from obstacles, passing through intermediate way points and compliance with the robots dynamic, kinematic and geometric constraints. âTimed elastic bandsâ explicitly consider spatialtemporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints such as limited robot velocities and accelerations. The trajectory planning operates in real time such that âtimed elastic bandsâ cope with dynamic obstacles and motion constraints. The âtimed elastic band problemâ is formulated as a scalarized multi-objective optimization problem. Most objectives are local and relate to only a small subset of parameters as they only depend on a few consecutive robot states. This local structure results in a sparse system matrix, which allows the utilization of fast and efï¬cient optimization techniques such as the open-source framework âg2oâ for solving âtimed elastic bandâ problems. The âg2oâ sparse system solvers have been successfully applied to VSLAM problems. This contribution describes the application and adaptation of the g2o-framework in the context of trajectory modiï¬cation with the âtimed elastic bandâ. Results from simulations and experiments with a real robot demonstrate that the implementation is robust and computationally efï¬cient.},

Abstract
While user experience (UX) evaluation is a core concern within the field of humanâcomputer interaction (HCI), there is currently no valid self-administered UX evaluation tool in French. The AttrakDiff 2 scale (Hassenzahl, Burmester, \& Koller, 2003) is a UX evaluation tool, which relies on a theoretical model distinguishing pragmatic and hedonic qualities of interactive systems. This paper describes the translation and validation of the French version of the AttrakDiff 2 scale in order to ease UX assessment in French-speaking users. Following the cross-cultural methodology developed by Vallerand (1989), the questionnaire was translated by trilingual researchers before being back-translated and validated by a panel of experts. A pre-test was conducted on 26 participants. The characteristics of the French version of the AttrakDiff 2 scale were then evaluated through a quantitative online study involving a sample of 381 users. The results confirm the expected 3 factors structure and a good internal consistency of each subscale. The links between factors are consistent with Hassenzahl's theoretical model (2003) where pragmatic and hedonic perceived attributes combine to form a judgment of attractiveness. The current French version of the AttrakDiff 2 scale is globally reliable with regards to the initial German version and presents satisfactory levels of validity and reliability.},
