\subsection{Human-Aware Robot Navigation}
The aim of robot navigation is to make the robot base move from one place to another while avoiding static and moving obstacles. However, when the robot has to move in an environment where humans are evolving other constraints must be added. The robot must not only avoid the humans, as any other moving obstacle to ensure their physical safety (not harming them), but also take into account their psychological safety (not stressing or frightening them) \cite{sisbot_human_2007}, \cite{kruse_human-aware_2013}.
